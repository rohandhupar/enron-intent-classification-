# enron-intent-classification-
Problem statement  Intent detection on Enron email set. We define "intent" here to correspond primarily to the categories "request" and "propose". In some cases, we also apply the positive label to some sentences from the "commit" category if they contain datetime, which makes them useful. Detecting the presence of intent in email is useful in many applications, e.g., machine mediation between human and email. The dataset contains parsed sentences from the email along with their intent (either 'yes' or 'no'). You need to build a learning model which detects whether a given sentence has intent or not. Its a 2-class classification problem. Although its not required you can refer this paper for more information on the dataset : Cohen, William W., Vitor R. Carvalho, and Tom M. Mitchell.
